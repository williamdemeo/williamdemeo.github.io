[I](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com) am a mathematician working at the 
[University of South Carolina](http://www.math.sc.edu), but on the
job market for fall 2014.

My main research interests are universal algebra, lattice theory, logic,
computability, proof theory, type theory and functional programming.
