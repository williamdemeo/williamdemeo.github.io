    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The repository <a href="https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/par-alg-rep">par-alg-rep</a>
contains some notes describing a few results that we worked out in the 
fall of 2016, while I was a postdoc at University of 
Hawaii, although the main result—a straight-forward proof of the fact 
that every finite lattice is the congruence lattice of a 
finite partial algebra—was discovered during a
visit to Chapman University in October 2016.</p>

<p>Bill Lampe pointed out that the main result here has been known for 
a long time. However, our proof seems new and simpler to us.</p>

<p>The note also describes closure operators and reviews some useful 
facts about them. Finally, we recall a theorem from Berman’s 
thesis that relates congruence lattices of partial algebras 
with those of total algebras.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the note is to describe some tools 
that we plan to exploit in our quest to represent every finite 
lattice as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra.</p>
