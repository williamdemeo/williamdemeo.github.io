<p>Consider two finite algebras that are the same
except for a relabelling of the operations.
Our intuition tells us that these are simply different names for the same
mathematical structure.
Formally, however, not only are these distinct mathematical objects, but also
they are <em>nonisomorphic!</em></p>

<p><em>Isotopy</em> is another well known notion of “sameness” that is 
broader than isomorphism. However, I recently proved a result that
shows why isotopy also fails to capture algebraic equivalence.

$\def\bA{\bf A} \def\bB{\bf B}  \def\bC{\bf C} \def\Con{\operatorname{Con}}$</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Below we give examples of algebraic structures that are the same 
except for the naming of their operations, yet they are not isomorphic.  (This
is an elaboration of Excercise 5.1 in
<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Algebras_lattices_varieties.html">Algebras, Lattices, Varieties</a>.)</p>

<p>Let $\bA$ be an algebra of size 4 and label the elements of the universe $\{1,2,3,4\}$.
Suppose $\bA$ has two unary operations, $f^\bA$ 
and $g^\bA$, where $f^\bA$ is the permutation $(1,2)(3,4)$ and 
$g^\bA$ is the permutation $(1,3)(2,4)$.  </p>

<p>Thus, the operations permute the elements as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/permutations.png" width="150" height="250"></p>

<p>The congruence lattice of the algebra $\bA$ is 
$M<em>3 = \{ 0_A , \theta</em>1, \theta<em>2, \theta</em>3, 1<em>A\}$, where (by abuse of
notation) we identify the congruences with their corrsponding partitions as
follows:
$0_A = |1|2|3|4| $,
$ \theta</em>1 = |1,2|3,4| $,
$\theta<em>2 = |1,3|2,4| $, $\theta</em>3 = |1,4|2,3| $, $1_A = |1,2,3,4|$.</p>

<p>Now, let </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bB = \bA/\theta_1 = \{ 1/\theta_1, 3/\theta_1\},</script>

<p>and let </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bC = \bA/\theta_2 = \{ 1/\theta_2, 2/\theta_2\}.</script>

<p>$\bB$ has operation $f^{\bB} = f^{\bA/\theta<em>1}$  and $g^{\bA/\theta</em>1}$, where </p>

<p>$f^{\bA/\theta<em>1}$ acts as the identity on the
classes  $1/\theta</em>1$ and $3/\theta<em>1$, thus $f^{\bA/\theta</em>1} =
\operatorname{id}_\bB$,</p>

<p>$g^{\bA/\theta<em>1}$ permutes the
classes  $1/\theta</em>1 \leftrightarrow 3/\theta_1$.</p>

<p>On the other hand, $\bC$ has operation $f^{\bA/\theta<em>2}$  and $g^{\bA/\theta</em>2}$, where </p>

<p>$f^{\bA/\theta<em>2}$ permutes the
classes  $1/\theta</em>2 \leftrightarrow 2/\theta_2$,</p>

<p>$g^{\bA/\theta<em>2}$ acts as the identity on the
classes  $1/\theta</em>2$ and $2/\theta<em>2$, thus $g^{\bA/\theta</em>2} =
\operatorname{id}_\bC$. </p>

<p>We can’t technically call $\bB$ and $\bC$ isomorphic because the $f$ map in
$\bB$ corresponds to the identity, while in $\bC$ it corresponds to the
permutation.  However, they are isomorphic as “nonindexed algebras.”</p>

<p>Clearly we have simply swapped the names of the operations, and any sane person
would agree that we have two “equivalent” algebraic structures. But these are
not considered equivalent, and they are not even isomorphic according to the
classical definition.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/williamdemeo/Isotopy">Isotopy GitHub repository</a>
contains an article in which I present algebras that are isotopic and yet
have vastly different congruence lattices.</p>

<p>Congruence relations of algebras are the kernels of homomorphisms, and the 
congruence lattice is a basic “algebraic” feature of an algebra. Certainly we
cannot accept a notion of “sameness” that equates two algebras with different
congruence lattices.</p>
